# BNBMiner Bot

Just a simple script for [BNBMiner](https://bnbminer.finance) that runs every half an hour to "hatch eggs".

## Running the Bot

Make sure that you make a .env file in your folder that includes the following variables:
  
BSC=https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/ (This one stays constant)  
ADDRESS (The addres of your own wallet)  
TOKEN_ADDRESS=0xce93F9827813761665CE348e33768Cb1875a9704 (This one stays constant; wallet address for BNBMiner)  
PRIVATE_KEY (Your private wallet key)  
  
To run it clone the repository and in your preferred command line tool run "python app.py"
